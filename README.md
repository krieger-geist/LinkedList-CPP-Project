# LinkedList-CPP-Project
A menu-driven C++ console application demonstrating Singly and Doubly Linked List operations.
---

## Overview

This project implements both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists with a user-friendly command-line interface.  
Operations include insertion, deletion, traversal, and more, all accessible through clear menus.

The program features:  
- Insert at beginning, end, and specified positions  
- Delete at beginning, end, and specified positions  
- Traverse and display the list elements  
- Robust input validation  
---

## Features

### Singly Linked List  
- Insert at beginning, end, or position  
- Delete from beginning, end, or position  
- Traverse and display  

### Doubly Linked List  
- Insert at beginning, end, or position  
- Delete from beginning, end, or position  
- Traverse forward and display  



## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Compile using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

## Linked List Project Menu *
1.Singly Linked List Operations
2.Doubly Linked List Operations
3.Exit
---Choose an option---:


After choosing an option, you get a submenu for operations on that list type.

---

## Dependencies

- Standard C++ library  
- Compatible with any modern C++ compiler (C++11 or later recommended)

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add search, reverse, and count functions for both list types  
- Enable saving/loading list data from files  
- Add graphical user interface (GUI)  
- Split into header/source files for better code organization
